# secret-santa
Secret Santa Email Script made for groups who can't get together to draw names.  

## Usage
Run the script with the following command. Please include a random seed as this
will help you re-run the script with the same results should you need to.  
You'll be prompted for your password.


```python3 secret_santa.py <sender_gmail_address> <seed>```  

You will have to allow "Less Secure" apps access to the sender gmail address.
This isn't generally advised as it drops a lot of gmails security around your
account. It might be better to use a throwaway address.

Visit your Google Account and turn on 'Allow less secure apps' [here](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps). For more detailed instructions see this post on devanswers.co, [Allow less secure apps to access your Gmail account] (https://devanswers.co/allow-less-secure-apps-access-gmail-account/).
